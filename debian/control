Description: Range over integers [0,n). Seriously, that's it.
 Package iter provides a syntactically different way to iterate over
 integers. That's it.
 .
 This package was intended to be an educational joke when it was
 released in 2014. People didn't get the joke part and started
 depending on it. That's fine, I guess. (This is the Internet.) But
 it's kinda weird. It's one line, and not even idiomatic Go style. I
 encourage you not to depend on this or write code like this, but I do
 encourage you to read the code and think about the representation of
 Go slices and why it doesn't allocate.
 .
 Please do not use this package. It is not intended for production use.
